# CSV Parser â€” Bootcamp Coding Test

Completed as part of a coding test towards the end of the Generation Data Engineering bootcamp, assessed by an external marker.

## Task Summary  
Given a CSV file containing quoted fields with employee details, implement a Python method to parse each row and output a clean, formatted string where fields are separated by `" - "`. Empty fields should be preserved as blank but included. The program must handle simple and edge-case CSV files, including those with commas inside quoted fields.

### Key Requirements
- Correctly parse quoted CSV lines  
- Output format: `FirstName - LastName - JobTitle - Notes`  
- Preserve empty fields represented as empty strings  
- Handle edge cases such as embedded commas within fields  

This was my first coding problem solved in the bootcamp, demonstrating fundamental skills in string parsing, data cleaning, and Python programming which are essential skills for Data Engineering in my opinion.

After completion, the external marker provided feedback and suggestions on best practices and design decisions, which helped improve my coding approach.
